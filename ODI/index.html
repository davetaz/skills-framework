		<p><b>The ODI has published the 2019 data skills framework to help organisations understand how to train their employees in using data better.</b></p>
		<p>Demand for workers with specialist data skills has more than tripled over five years (+231%). Organisations around the world are implementing data training programmes to help skills up workers to be more data literate. At the ODI we have used our skills framework to help organisations like Lloydâ€™s of London and the Co-op use data better. Adaptations of the skills framework have also been used to start entire training schools at the national level in countries like Tanzania.</p>
		<p>Let's bust one myth straight away - we don't all need to become expert programmers in Python or R to be a modern data worker. Organisations who want to use data better will typically need a wide range of skills - from strategy to innovation, from programming to publication. That creates lots of opportunities for lots of different types of people, not just developers. The ODI skills framework will help you identify the data skills you might need for your discipline and suggest where to get started.</p>
		<p>Even though Data Literacy cuts across an entire organisation, not everyone requires the same level or direction of training. There are different roles and responsibilities, and different levels of awareness and practical skills required to work better with data.</p>
		<p>The ODI Data Skills framework is a holistic view on the broad range of skills organisations need across their workforce to work better with data. </p>

		<p><b>Even though Data Literacy cuts across an entire organisation, not everyone requires the same level or direction of training. The framework does not therefore prescribe a set pathway for everyone, rather it is built around a central core.</b></p>
		<p>To the right side of the core are the more technical and analytical skills involved in data management, data analysis and data science. To the left of the core are data stewardship, leadership and innovation skills. To be successful with data everyone will need an awareness of a number of these areas while being a specialist in others. This will mean each person's pathway will likely start from their specialism and work out across the framework. At the ODI we use our data ecosystem mapping and persona mapping tools to help us understand the needs and pathways of people within an organisation.</p>

			<h1 class="w3-center">The Core</h1>
			<p>The core covers what data is and how it affects us on a day to day basis.</p>
			<p>At an organisational level, the core ties the framework together and helps define and communicate the organisational strategy around data.</p>
			<p>What is data to your organisation?<br/>
			How does it create value?<br/>
			What insights does it generate?<br/>
			What is your data strategy?<br/>
			How does data drive change?<br/>
			...<br/></p>
			<p>While senior members of an organisation will be driving the strategy and leading change, everyone should be aware of these core areas and how they relate to the organisation.</p>

			<h1 class="w3-center">The data management specialisms</h1>
			<p>This area of the framework starts to focus on managing data technically.</p>
			<p>Data should be usable by as many people as possible.</p>
			<p>This is underpinned by a strong data infrastructure that follows common standards allowing data to be discovered, transformed, linked and used.</p>
			<p>The ODI has extensive experience in data management. As leader of the <a href="https://www.openactive.io/" target="_blank">OpenActive</a> we have helped convene a communitee to standardise, link and unlock sporting data to help get people more active.</p>

		<div class="w3-col m6 w3-padding-large">
			<h1 class="w3-center">The data science specialisms</h1>
			<p>A modern data scientist is expected to be a a catalyst for change in an organisation.</p>
			<p>This requires not only performing complex data manipulation, but also communicating findings to senior level decision-makers.</p>
			<p>This requires a broad set of knowledge and skills.</p>
			<p>The ODI works with organisations to ensure data analysis can be a catalyst for change. From <a href="https://london-fire.labs.theodi.org" target="_blank">analysing the impact of closing fire stations in london</a>, <a href="http://britains-diet.labs.theodi.org/" target="_blank">exploring britains diet</a> to <a href="https://opencorporates.com/viz/financial/index.html" target="_blank">releaving the facebook network of companies</a>. The ODI offers both technical expertise and training to help data deliver effective insight and change.

			<h1 class="w3-center">The data steward's specialisms</h1>
			<p>A data steward helps ensure data is accessible by the right people and that the use of that data benefits everyone.</p>
			<p>Data stewards must understand the entire spectrum of data as well as the ecosystems and people in those ecosystems that are impacted by data.</p>
			<p>A leading data steward will play a key role in measuring success of data in an ecosystem and help manage change and risk.</p>
			<p>The ODI both expertise and practical tools to help organisations steward data for the benefit of everyone including the <a href="https://theodi.org/about-the-odi/the-data-spectrum/" target="_blank">data spectrum</a>, <a href="https://theodi.org/article/data-ethics-canvas/" target="_blank">ethics cavnas</a> and <a href="https://theodi.org/article/data-ecosystem-mapping-tool/" target="_blank">ecosystem mapping tool</a>.</p>

			<h1 class="w3-center">The data innovators specialisms</h1>
			<p>A data innovator looks to the future.</p>
			<p>They are fostering the next generation of data innovators, designing services to benefit everyone and helping achieve sustainability.</p>
			<p>Data innovation delivers value to organisations by identifying and implementing useful combinations of both existing and novel technologies, business models, and processes.</p>
			<p>The ODI, as an incubator of many startups and <a href="https://theodi.org/article/success-celebrated-at-odi-summit-with-startup-programme-awards/" target="_blank">leader of highly successful startup programmes across the world</a>, has helped unlocked millions of dollars of funding, created hundreds of jobs and importantly created valuable services for everyone.</p>

			<p>Leaders deliver change.</p>
			<p>They are ultimately responsible for implementing policy, setting strategy, prioritising action and leading change.</p>
			<p>Changing the way we work with data drives changes in the way things are done. From delivering new processes to new services, leaders will advocate and champion programmes that help organisations and industries evolve.</p>
			<p>Over the years the ODI has created the <a href="https://theodi.org/project/open-data-leaders-network/" target="_blank">leaders network</a> and a <a href="https://theodi.org/global-network-directory/odi-partners/" target="_blank">partnership programme</a> where members come together to drive positive change with data.</p>
